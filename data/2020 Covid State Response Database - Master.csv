Public Health Guidance on School Reopening,What are the state's recommendation for reopening schools based on local public health conditions? (Free Response),"State reopening guidance references statewide risk dashboard but does not make recommendations for reopening based on this dashboard. State communicates expectation for campuses to reopen for traditional learning for 20-21 SY. Local boards of education determine whether campuses stay open, in consultation with Alabama Department of Health, local public health officials. ","No statewide mandate but state provides recommendations on how districts can operate under low-risk, medium risk, and high risk enivronments. These risk levels are not precisely defined via indicators but instead use words like ""high level of community transmission."" The guidance suggests that decisions about whether to open or close cannot be made soley on epidemiological grounds as these entail complex tradeoffs, such as community vulnerability to COVID-19. ",The Arizona Department of Health Services recommends county-specific public health benchmarks to be in the moderate or minimal transmission category in all three benchmarks for two weeks in order to provide hybrid learning. Benchmarks include a two-week decline in the number of cases OR a two-week case rate of less than 100 cases per 100K people within the county; two weeks of percent positivity less than 7% within the county; and two weeks with hospital visits due to COVID-19-like illness below 10% within the region. ,"The state is requiring districts to open for 5 days of onsite instruction. Guidance is offered to school districts around assessment of health risks for staff and students and their impacts on delivery of onsite instruction. Primary factor is active cases per population but school systems are directed to consult with the Department of Health. No clear benchmarks are offered, though the state does provide qualitative assessments for ""limited response,"" ""moderate response,"" and ""critical response."" ","Schools are not permitted to open under the state's blueprint until tranmission is no longer ""widespread,"" which is defined as more than 7 daily new cases per 100K people and more than 8% positivity rates. Counties with ""substantial"" spread, defined as 4-7 new daily cases per 100K residents and 5-8% positivity rates for at least two weeks can reopen for in-person instruction subject to state guidlines.","Recommendations for school reopening are tied to state's phased public health guidance. ""Stay at home"" signals high COVID-19 incidence in the community and means schools are using remote learning except in limited circumstances. ""Safer at home"" signals moderate COVID-19 incidence in the community and means schools can reopen with some operational adjustments. ""Protect our neighbors"" signals low COVID-19 incidence in the community and means schools are open with some operational adjustments. State is currently in ""safer at home."" New draft guidance will tie phases to specific metrics like new cases and percent positivity would recommend schools reopen for some in-person (including hybrid) starting at Level 2 - Safer at Home -which requires new cases to be at 75-175 per 100K people, <10% positivity, stable or declining hospitalizations, stable or improving EPI trend, no anticipated future transmission risk factors. ","Department of Education and Department of Health recommend that decisions on in-person vs. remote learning should be based on indicators of the spread and prevalence of COVID-19 in the community and on the physical and operational ability of schools to implement mitigation strategies. Indicators for consideration of learning models: the number of new cases per 100K people per day (7-day average), percent positivity, number of new COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100K (7-day average), COVID-19-like and influenza like illness syndromic surveillance. Remote learning when cases per 100K people (7-day average) is greater than 25 (hybrid for 10-25 per 100K). Secondary indicators should be trending flat for hybrid. ","School reopening working group created green/yellow/red framework to guide reopening. The ""scenarios"" are based on public health data around average daily hospitalizations, new COVID-19 cases and percent of persons testing positive. Scenario 1: minimal community spread (<10 cases per 100K people, <3% positive test rate, <10 average daily hospitalizations per 100K) and school open for in-person instruction. Scenario 2: moderate community spread (10-100 new cases per 100K, 3% to 10% positivity, 10-25 average daily hospitalizations per 100K) and hybrid learning. Scenario 3: significant spread (>100 new cases per 100K, <10% positivity rate, >25 average daily hospitalizations per 100K) and remote learning only. Currently districts in the state fall under Scenario 2, which corresponds to a hybrid model of in-person and remote learning. ","The Department of Education directed school districts to reopen with the full ""panopoly of services"" and state funding is contingent on doing so. No evidence that this requirement is tied to a phased reopening framework or key public health indicators. ",Whether schools reopen appears to be a local decision and is not tied to a phased reopening plan or public health benchmarks.  ,School reopening tied to recommendations based on level of community transmission though no specific indicators are referenced. School buildings are recommended to be closed when substantial transmission occurs. ,"In-person instruction is recommended as regions enter Phase 4. Certain operational changes are required for reopening. Phases are based on local public health indicators, though no clear benchmarks are offered.","Schools are authorized to reopen in Stage 4.5. The state is using four public health benchmarks: the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients statwide has decreased for 14 days, the state retains its surge capacity for critical care beds and ventilators, the state retains the ability to test residents who are symptomatic, and health officials have systems in place to perform contact tracing. ",The state's governor issued a proclamation that requires school districts to offer in person instruction unless the district receives a waiver from the state. Waivers will only be approved if a county's coronavirus positivity rate surpasses 15 percent. ,"The state released new criteria to guide school reopening decisions based on color-coded ""gating criteria."" School and community public health indicators inform phased reopening. Schools to reopen when student absenteeism is less than 3% above baseline ADA, 2 week positivity rate <5%, 0-50 two-week cumulative county incident rate per 100K residents, decreasing trend in county incidence rate, and >30% hospital capacity.","The governor issued new guidance recommending schools wait to reopen until September 28. He said the decision was driven by four factors: Kentucky's cases being near a peak, an increase in infection rates among children across the U.S., the experience of school districts in other states, and families continuing to travel to hotspots for vacations against the advice of health officials. No specific benchmarks are offered. ","Schools may reopen in phases 1, 2, and 3 with certain restrictions. LEAs are required to adopt policies in accordance with the state's health and safety requirements for reopening. This includes standards for minimum group size for each of 3 phases. While the phases are tied to specific public helath indicators, schools are permitted to open under all three phases. ","Phased reopening guidance based on ""holistic assessment of quantitative and qualitative information."" Indicators include but are not limited to: recent data on case rates, positivity rates, and syndromic data. ""Red"" indicates the county has a high risk of COVID-19 spread and in-person instruction is not advisable. ""Yellow"" suggests the county has an elevated risk of COVID-19 spread and schools may consider hybrid instructional models as a way to reduce the number of people in schools. ""Green"" suggests the county has a relatively low risk of COVID-19 spread and schools may consider in-person instruction, as long as they are able to implement the required health and safety measures. ","The state encourages districts to reopen for in-person learning when it is safe to do so, guided by local public health authorities. Health metrics to guide school reopening decisions include the positivity rate and new case rate. Other operational changes to schools are required as part of reopening. State guidance on reopening did not arrive until August 27, just days before schools were set to start. ","On August 11, the state released new color-coded indicators that summarize public health indicators in local communities. The MA Dept of Elementary and Secondary Education communicates an expectation that districts will use the state's recommended learning model for the color-coded indicators. ""Red"" = average daily cases is >8 per 100K people and remote learning, ""Yellow""= average daily cases is between 4-8 per 100K and hybrid learning model (or remote if extenuating circumstances), ""Green"" = average daily cases is <4 per 100K and full-time in-person learning model (or hybrid if extenuating circumstances). ","Six phases for reopening: Remote learning for phases 1-3, in-person permitted with stringent safety protocols for phase 4, in-person permitted with moderate safety protocols for phase 5, in-person permitted with minimal safety protocols for phase 6. Phases aligned to Michigan Safe Start Plan. Progress through phases depends on cmprehensive review of data on new cases, health care system capacity, and capacity for testing and contact tracing. School systems will retain the authority to close school buildings even if they have not been mandated to do so. ","Minnesota Department of Health uses data on biweekly case rate from counties to determine base learning model (>10 cases per 10K residents is considered elevated risk of transmission). 0-9 cases per 10K = in-person learning for all students. 10-19 cases per 10K = in-person for elementary, hybrid for secondary. 20-29 cases per 10K = hybrid learning all students. 30-49 cases per 10K = hybrid learning for elementary students, remote learning for secondary. 50+ cases per 10K = remote learning for all students. If a school district or charter school chooses a more resitrictive learning model, it must notify the education commissioner. Schools are expected to implement required health practices to reopen. ","Schools are allowed to implement a traditional, virtual, or hybrid plan. The state recommends districts prioritize in-person schooling for younger students and other operational shifts. An executive order from the governor delayed the start of school year in some districts that are experiencing high levels of community transmission. ","The state provides recommendations around operational shifts to support school reopening, such as screening protocols, physical distancing, and use of masks. There are currently no statewide health mandates related to K-12 schools. Decisions to open along with methods of instruction used during the 20-21 school year are made by local school leaders and local boards of education. ",Schools allowed to reopen under three phases of governor's reopening plan. Phase 1 includes the most recommendations around operational shifts. Progression through phases based on evaluation of public health indicators. ,"Recommendations tied to four levels based on community spread. Green/Minimal Spread = in-person instruction. Yellow/Minimal to Moderate Spread = enhanced mitigation strategies. Orange/Moderate spread = reduced number of students in building. Red/Significant = remote learning. Recommendations for local health departments analyze risk variables, such as number of positive cases, percent of positive cases, hospitalization rate, and the increase in positive cases from previous rolling averages. ","Districts and schools have local discretion to reopen school buildings under social distancing protocols. The state recommends a variety of operational changes to support health and safety. Under ""substantial"" spread, schools are advised to implement remote learning if feasible. Under ""minimal to moderate spread"" operational changes are recommended and students at increased risk of illness are recommended for remote learning.","The state recommends a variety of operational changes to schools for health and safety. These guidelines are not tied to specific benchmarks, though the state recommends districts prepare to shift from in-person to hybrid/remote instructional settings as needed based on disease transmission.","Districts must reopen for in-person instruction if they can meet health and safety guidelines. Districts are permitted to delay in-person instruction if they can show the Department of Education that they cannot meet the health and safety requirements, and provide how they will address the outstanding issues, and a proposed timeline for reopening physical school spaces to students and staff.  ","The state put a pause on the implementation of hybrid / in-person models until September 8, based on recent increase in community transmission (based on new case numbers). All school districts are eligible to begin the school year under remote learning. The state will adopt a phased approach to reentry after Labor Day, provided public health conditions warrant. ",The state recommends schools reopen if daily infection rates remain below 5 percent using a 14-day average. The state also requires a variety of operational changes to support health and safety. ,"Districts are directed to have three plans that reflect varying levels of social distancing, with Plan C providing remote-only learning. The state requires a variety of operational changes to support health and safety. The governor monitors public health data and makes recommendations about Plan A, B or C. ",Districts are advised to make reopening decisions based on the current status of the virus spread. Health and safety plans must be approved by each school district's school board in consultation with local public health units. The K-12 Smart Restart has adopted color-coded guidance in the state's reopening plan. Red/Critical Risk = uncontrolled community transmission and school closed. Orange / High Risk = significant transmission and schools closed. Yellow / Moderate Risk = heightened transmission and may reopen for in-person instruction with approved health and safety plan. Green / Low Risk = low case counts and schools may open for in-person instruction with approved health and safety plan. Blue = New normal. ,Ohio does not appear to prevent schools from opening or mandate that they reopen. The state has guidelines for reopening but they are focused on policies and prevention rather than specific criteria. The state has a phased reopening plan but it does not appear to be specifically tied to school reopenings.,"Oklahoma established reopening guidelines that are tied to the state's general reopening plan for counties, but districts ultimately can make the decision. When counties are in ""level orange"" and case loads are under 25 per 100,000 residents, they are recommended to offer hybrid schedules to all students. When counties are in ""level orange"" and case loads are between 25-50 per 100,000 residents, they should offer in-person instruction to no more than 25% of their student population, prioritizing the most vulnerable students. When counties are in ""level yellow"" and have less than 15 cases per 100,000 residents, they should offer in-person instruction, and masks are recommended. About half of Oklahoma's counties appear to be in yellow and the rest are in some form of orange. ","The state recommends that districts return to in-person instruction when they meet the following conditions: 1) schools must be in a county that is no longer in baseline phase. 2) For a school district that draws 10% or more students/staff from more than one county, metrics for each county should be considered. 3) case rate <10 per 100K residents in preceding 7 days, test positivity rate <5% in preceding 7 days. County metrics must be met for 3 weeks in row. The state also offers an exception for in-person instruction for K-3 grades if the case rate is <30 cases per 100K residents. ","The state recommends Pre-K through 12 schools open for in-person instruction based on the incidence rate of new cases per 100k people (most recent 7 ays) and/or the percent positivity (most recent 7 days). When community transmission is low, defined as fewer than 10 cases per 100k and less than 5% positivity rate, full time in-person instruction is recommended. A blended learning model OR remote learning model is recommended when community transnission is moderate. ","The governor announced that schools could open and offer full, in-person learning beginning September 14, except for Providence and Central Falls. These cities do not meet the state's criteria of community spread of less than 100 cases per 100,000 residents. The state considered additional system readiness indicators when determining if schools could reopen. All schools are following a uniform calendar this academic year.","The state department of education required school districts to submit reopening plans that included information about in-person learning as an eventual goal. Although the governor has urged schools to reopen, the state superintendent of public instruction approved plans that include fully remote learning to start. The state department of health says ""there is no defined standard or threshold for closing schools or classrooms.""","South Dakota schools can reopen in consultation with local public health officials. Guidance from the state department of education suggests looking at community spread data maintained by the state but doesn't tie reopening to any specific indicator or threshold. This guidance also indicates that ""face-to-face"" learning should be a priority for the 2020-21 school year. ",School districts appear to have authority to reopen or stay closed without approval from the state department of education. Reopening frameworks recommend some form of in-person learning even when there is community spread if the school system has taken appropriate prevention measures. Guidance from the state department of education indicates schools should consider closing for at least 14 days when confirmed caseloads among children or adults at schools are rising. ,"Texas schools may provide remote learning during the first four weeks of school and may obtain a waiver for an additional four weeks, but otherwise must offer in-person instruction to families that desire it. (They most also offer remote options). School districts can also modify the academic year (such as delaying the start) provided they meet instructional day requirements. There appears to be some amibiguity under state law if local public health officials can order districts to close. Districts can close campuses if they have a confirmed case, but there doesn't appear to be general guidelines for reopening in that scenario or for closing more than one campus. ","Utah school districts and public charter schools were required to develop reopening plans, but these do not appear to be tied to any specific criteria on disease spread for reopening. The guidance says decisions about opening in the fall will be made by local system leaders and local public health officials, generally. Utah has a four-tiered set of restrictions, generally, on businesses depending on disease spread. All of its counties are currently in the lowest two levels of restrictions.","Vermont delayed the start of school until September 8, however, earlier guidance indicates in-person learning for at least grades K-5 is strongly recommended and it appears there are no current restrictions on schools for offering in-person learning after September 8.","Guidance from the state this summer indicates that schools may offer limited in-person instruction when the state is in Phase 2 of its reopening plan, and full in-person instruction when the state is in Phase 3. Schools' ability to move to these phases themselves depends on where the state is and subject to approval from the state department of education. Although the state is in Phase 3, there appear to be new limits placed on some regions of the state and the threshold for moving between phases as a state is unclear.",The Department of Health provided a decision tree to guide local districts in the provision of in-person instruction for K-12 students. No in-person instruction is recommended when community transmission is high - defined as >75 cases/100K residents/14 days. Districts are encouraged to consider expanding in-person learning to elementary students when community transmission reaches 25-75 cases/100K/14 days. ,"The governor ordered schools not begin the school year until September 8. The state tracks disease spread by county. Schools can open for hybrid or in-person learning when their county has 3.1 - 9.9 cases per 100K people, with students limiting interactions to within cohorts and mask wearing. When counties have 3 or fewer cases per 100K people, cohorts do not appear to be required but masks are, and other social distancing efforts are encouraged.","The state department of health appears to allow in-person instruction if districts follow guidelines developed by the Department of Public Instruction, which has developed a risk assessment tool for school districts to complete in tandem with local or tribal health authorities, although this seems to include many preventative or policy steps rather than indicators of viral spread.",The state department of health permits in-person instruction with spacing guidelines for all students in groups of up to 50 persons. The state department of education recommends in-person instruction unless a local health agency requires a school district to close or the district has developed opening criteria with local authorities.
